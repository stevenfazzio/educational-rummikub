# Understanding the Code - Overview

Let's explore how Educational Rummikub is built! Don't worry if you've never looked at code before - we'll take it step by step.

## Think of It Like a Restaurant üçΩÔ∏è

To understand how this game works, imagine a restaurant:

- **The Kitchen** (`tiles.py`, `rules.py`) - Where the basic ingredients are prepared
- **The Manager's Office** (`game.py`) - Where all the business logic happens
- **The Waitstaff** (`display.py`) - Who interact with customers
- **The Dining Room** (`player.py`) - Where customers sit
- **The Front Door** (`main.py`) - Where customers enter

Each part has a specific job, and they work together to create the experience!

## System Architecture

Here's how the components connect and interact:

    style F fill:#81C784,stroke:#388E3C,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

The diagram shows three layers:
- **User Interface** (blue): Where players interact with the game
- **Game Logic** (orange): Where game rules and state are managed
- **Data Layer** (green): Where game data structures are defined

## The Files and What They Do

### üì¶ `tiles.py` - The Game Pieces
**What it does**: Defines what tiles are and how to create a deck

Think of this as the "game piece factory." It knows:
- What a tile looks like (number + color)
- How to create a full deck of 106 tiles
- How to shuffle and deal tiles

**Key concept**: This file creates the building blocks everything else uses.

### üìã `rules.py` - The Rule Book
**What it does**: Checks if moves are legal

Like a referee, this file answers questions:
- "Is this a valid group?" (like [5 red] [5 blue] [5 black])
- "Is this a valid run?" (like [7 blue] [8 blue] [9 blue])
- "Does this initial meld have enough points?"

**Key concept**: This file never changes the game - it just says "yes" or "no" to moves.

### üéÆ `game.py` - The Game Manager
**What it does**: Keeps track of everything happening in the game

This is the "brain" that:
- Knows whose turn it is
- Tracks what's on the table
- Applies moves when players make them
- Declares winners

**Key concept**: This file manages the game state (what's happening right now).

### üë§ `player.py` - The Players
**What it does**: Represents each person playing

Simple but important - tracks:
- Player's name
- Their tiles
- Whether they've made their initial meld

**Key concept**: This file is about data storage, not decision-making (humans make the decisions).

### üñ•Ô∏è `display.py` - The Screen
**What it does**: Shows the game to players and gets their input

This file handles:
- Printing the table and tiles nicely
- Showing menus
- Getting player choices
- Making things colorful

**Key concept**: This is the only file that talks to the player directly.

### üö™ `main.py` - The Entry Point
**What it does**: Starts everything up

When you run `python main.py`, this file:
- Shows the main menu
- Sets up new games
- Connects all the other pieces

**Key concept**: This is where the program begins.

## How They Work Together

Here's what happens when you play a tile:

```
1. display.py shows you the menu and gets your choice
   ‚Üì
2. main.py receives your choice and asks game.py to handle it
   ‚Üì
3. game.py checks with rules.py: "Is this move legal?"
   ‚Üì
4. rules.py examines the tiles and says "yes" or "no"
   ‚Üì
5. If yes, game.py updates the game state
   ‚Üì
6. display.py shows you the updated table
```

## Reading Your First Code

Let's look at a real example from `player.py`:

```python
def add_tile(self, tile: Tile) -> None:
    """Add a single tile to the player's hand."""
    self.tiles.append(tile)
```

Let's break this down:
- `def` means "define a new function" (a set of instructions)
- `add_tile` is the name we're giving these instructions
- `self` refers to the player we're working with
- `tile: Tile` means we expect to receive a tile
- `self.tiles.append(tile)` adds the tile to the player's collection

In plain English: "Here's how to add a tile to a player's hand: take their list of tiles and add the new tile to it."

## Patterns You'll See

As you explore the code, you'll notice patterns:

### 1. **Functions** - Reusable Instructions
```python
def do_something():
    # Instructions here
```

### 2. **Classes** - Blueprints for Objects
```python
class Player:
    # What a player has and can do
```

### 3. **If Statements** - Making Decisions
```python
if player.has_melded:
    # Do this
else:
    # Do that
```

### 4. **Lists** - Collections of Things
```python
tiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]
```

## Remember

- üîç **You don't need to understand everything at once**
- üìö **Each file has one main job**
- üß© **The files work together like puzzle pieces**
- üí° **The code is just instructions written in a special language**

Take your time, and don't hesitate to jump between files to see how they connect!
