# Understanding the Code - Overview

Let's explore how Educational Rummikub is built! Don't worry if you've never looked at code before - we'll take it step by step.

## Think of It Like a Board Game Night üé≤

To understand how this game works, imagine organizing a game night:

- **The Host** (`main.py`) - Organizes everything and starts the game
- **The Game Table** (`display.py`) - Where everyone sees and plays the game
- **The Game Master** (`game.py`) - Manages turns and enforces rules
- **The Rulebook** (`rules.py`) - The official rules that say what's legal
- **The Scorecards** (`player.py`) - Tracks what tiles each player has
- **The Game Box** (`tiles.py`) - Contains all the physical game pieces

Each part has a specific job, and they work together to create the game experience!

## System Architecture

Here's how the components connect and interact:

    style F fill:#81C784,stroke:#388E3C,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

The diagram shows three layers:
- **User Interface** (blue): Where players interact with the game
- **Game Logic** (orange): Where game rules and state are managed
- **Data Layer** (green): Where game data structures are defined

## The Files and What They Do

### üö™ `main.py` - The Host
**What it does**: Entry point that organizes everything

Like a game night host, this file:
- Shows the main menu
- Sets up new games
- Connects all the other pieces
- Starts the game loop

**Key concept**: This is where the program begins.

### üñ•Ô∏è `display.py` - The Game Table
**What it does**: Shows the game to players and gets their input

Just like the physical table where you play, this file:
- Shows everyone what's on the table
- Displays each player's tiles (only to them!)
- Gets player choices
- Makes everything look nice with colors

**Key concept**: This is the only file that talks to the player directly.

### üéÆ `game.py` - The Game Master
**What it does**: Manages the game and enforces fairness

Like a game master who runs the game, this file:
- Knows whose turn it is
- Tracks what's on the table
- Applies moves when players make them
- Declares winners

**Key concept**: This file manages the game state (what's happening right now).

### üìã `rules.py` - The Rulebook
**What it does**: The official rules that determine what's legal

Like consulting the rulebook, this file answers:
- "Is this a valid group?" (like [5 red] [5 blue] [5 black])
- "Is this a valid run?" (like [7 blue] [8 blue] [9 blue])
- "Does this initial meld have enough points?"

**Key concept**: This file never changes the game - it just says "yes" or "no" to moves.

### üë§ `player.py` - The Scorecards
**What it does**: Keeps track of each player's tiles

Like personal scorecards, this file tracks:
- Player's name
- Their tiles (their "hand")
- Whether they've made their initial meld

**Key concept**: This file is about data storage, not decision-making (humans make the decisions).

### üì¶ `tiles.py` - The Game Box
**What it does**: Contains all the game pieces

Like the game box with all the tiles, this file:
- Defines what a tile is (number + color)
- Creates a full deck of 106 tiles
- Can shuffle and deal tiles

**Key concept**: This file creates the building blocks everything else uses.

## How They Work Together

Here's what happens when you play a tile:

```
1. display.py shows you the menu and gets your choice
   ‚Üì
2. main.py receives your choice and asks game.py to handle it
   ‚Üì
3. game.py checks with rules.py: "Is this move legal?"
   ‚Üì
4. rules.py examines the tiles and says "yes" or "no"
   ‚Üì
5. If yes, game.py updates the game state
   ‚Üì
6. display.py shows you the updated table
```

## Reading Your First Code

Let's look at a real example from `player.py`:

```python
def add_tile(self, tile: Tile) -> None:
    """Add a single tile to the player's hand."""
    self.tiles.append(tile)
```

Let's break this down:
- `def` means "define a new function" (a set of instructions)
- `add_tile` is the name we're giving these instructions
- `self` refers to the player we're working with
- `tile: Tile` means we expect to receive a tile
- `self.tiles.append(tile)` adds the tile to the player's collection

In plain English: "Here's how to add a tile to a player's hand: take their list of tiles and add the new tile to it."

## Patterns You'll See

As you explore the code, you'll notice patterns:

### 1. **Functions** - Reusable Instructions
```python
def do_something():
    # Instructions here
```

### 2. **Classes** - Blueprints for Objects
```python
class Player:
    # What a player has and can do
```

### 3. **If Statements** - Making Decisions
```python
if player.has_melded:
    # Do this
else:
    # Do that
```

### 4. **Lists** - Collections of Things
```python
tiles = [tile1, tile2, tile3]
```

## Remember

- üîç **You don't need to understand everything at once**
- üìö **Each file has one main job**
- üß© **The files work together like puzzle pieces**
- üí° **The code is just instructions written in a special language**
