## Design Principles

1. **Clear Code Architecture** - Modular design with single responsibility per file
2. **Descriptive Naming** - Self-documenting variable and function names
3. **Comprehensive Comments** - Every non-trivial function is well-documented
4. **Standard Python** - Uses only built-in libraries, no external dependencies
5. **Type Hints** - Modern Python with type annotations for clarity

## Getting Started

```bash
# Run the game
python main.py

# Run tests
python -m unittest discover tests/

# Start game with specific players
python main.py --players "Alice,Bob,Charlie"
```

## Code Example

The codebase emphasizes clarity. Here's an example from `tiles.py`:

```python
class Tile:
    """Represents a single Rummikub tile."""
    
    def __init__(self, number: int, color: str):
        """
        Create a new tile.
        
        Args:
            number: The tile's number (1-13) or 0 for joker
            color: One of 'red', 'blue', 'black', 'orange', or 'joker'
        """
        self.number = number
        self.color = color
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """Display tile in readable format: [5 red] or [Joker]"""
        if self.is_joker():
            return "[Joker]"
        return f"[{self.number} {self.color}]"
    
    def is_joker(self) -> bool:
        """Check if this tile is a joker."""
        return self.color == 'joker'
```

## Game Rules

The implementation follows standard Rummikub rules:

- **Sets**: Groups of 3-4 tiles with same number, different colors OR runs of 3+ consecutive numbers in same color
- **Initial Meld**: First play must total 30+ points
- **Jokers**: Can substitute any tile, worth the value of replaced tile
- **Winning**: First player to play all tiles wins

## Playing the Game

The game supports 2-4 human players taking turns at the same computer. The interface is designed to be clear and intuitive:

1. Each player sees their tiles when it's their turn
2. The table shows all played sets
3. Players can play new melds, add to existing sets, or draw
4. The game validates all moves according to Rummikub rules

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stevenfazzio/educational-rummikub.git
cd educational-rummikub

# Run the game
python main.py

# Or jump straight into a 2-player game
python main.py --players "Alice,Bob"
```

## Learning from this Codebase

This codebase demonstrates:

- **Object-oriented design** with clear class hierarchies
- **Separation of concerns** (display, game logic, and rules are separate)
- **Validation patterns** for complex game rules
- **State management** in turn-based games
- **Clean architecture** with no circular dependencies
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit tests for all components
- **Modern Python** with type hints and dataclasses

## Why This Project?

This project serves multiple purposes:

1. **Learn Python** - See how a real application is structured
2. **Understand Software Design** - Study clean architecture patterns
3. **Practice Reading Code** - Everything is extensively documented
4. **Make Modifications** - Guides help you customize the game
5. **Have Fun** - It's a working game you can play!
